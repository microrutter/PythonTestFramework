### PythonTestFramework
A python test framework 

Currently a basic one built form http://www.letskodeit.com/ for the most part and the api framework added from https://github.com/mwinteringham/api-framework/tree/master/python

Will be adding my own touch to it as I go along

## New

Now added beautifulsoup to the framework and added locust to do some light load testing.
